# ECO5037S FinTech and Cryptocurrencies Final Exam

This repo contains the Python modules developed to answer **Question 5(ii)** on Atomic Transfers and **Question 6(vi)** on Fractional NFTs.

### Atomic Transfers

`atomic_transfer.py` is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows a user to execute an atomic transfer of Algos and/or UCTZAR between two Algorand wallets and check the wallet balances. The code includes setup utilities to create Algorand accounts, issue the UCTZAR ASA, and opt each account in to use the ASA.

### Fractional NFTs

`fractional_nft_algorand.py` is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows a user to transfer a fraction of Luftballons (LUFT) between three Algorand wallets and check the NFT balances. The code includes setup utilities to create Algorand accounts, issue the 9.9 LUFT, and opt each account in to use the ASA.
