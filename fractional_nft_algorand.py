"""
Using the Algorand Python SDK, write an application that illustrates how to issue Fractional NFT's on the Algorand blockchain. 

Once issued, you must distribute the fractional NFT's to upto 3 different recipients. 
Once you have distributed some of the fractional NFT's, you are required to demonstrate using Python code 
how you will check each of the recipient addresses for the existence of the fractional NFT 
(i.e. prove that each address does indeed hold the fractional NFT) and print a message to the console to display the result 
e.g. if the user does indeed have the NFT then the output should be include the address and the number of units of the fractional NFT they hold; 
if the user does not have the NFT, the output should include the user address and a message that the user does not hold any units of the fractional NFT.


Notes
Make use of the Algorand Python SDK and connect to the Algorand Testnet. You can use a public node such as https://testnet-api.algonode.cloud.  
A receiver of an NFT/ASA needs to first opt-in.
